# The Revenger - 4x4 Rubik’s Cube Solving Robot

The Revenger is a World Record Attempt 4x4 Rubik’s Cube Solving Robot.  
It was developed as part of my undergraduate dissertation project for Computer Science at the University of Bristol.

The robot combines real-time computer vision, computational solving algorithms, and physical hardware control into a fully autonomous solving system.
